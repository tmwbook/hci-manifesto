      <p>Hello World!  My name is Tom and at time of writing I am a Sophomore at WPI.  Before we get into the design philosophy that I have had this term in Human Computer Interaction, I’m going to tell you a little bit about me so you can have a better frame of reference for where these ideas are founded.  I am someone who has always been around computers.  Ever since elementary school, I’ve been exposed to the internet and have seen the fads of design come and go (gradiented buttons were quite the time).  I have also been programming for six years now, and have been able to grow out of the “it’s functional” stage of my career, now focusing on both the usability of the program as well as the features included in it.  My work tends to bend towards website development, and with ‘flat’ and ‘minimal’ type designs being so popular in the past 2 years, the projects that I have contributed to have some of this reflected in them (take, for instance, this webpage!). </p>
      <h4 class="w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-10">Design Manifesto</h4>
        <p>I am someone that tries to look at the practical purpose of the programs that I create.  Throughout the class, there were very real applications of the concepts that we were learning.  We were encouraged to explore the real world applications of each project to aide in the development of our project.  Along these lines, if the projects are made to be used by a person, why not ask the person what they want to do with the application and how they want to use it?  This is the theory behind “Wizard of Oz” user testing, a personal favorite of the course. <a href="http://www.usabilitynet.org/v3/tools/wizard.htm">http://www.usabilitynet.org/v3/tools/wizard.htm</a></p>
        <p>In Tension and Wellbeing, this technique helped us target use cases and decision paths in a seemingly infinite field provided by FlowXO and Affectiva.  By understanding what people would actually like to do with the idea that we created, the implementation became much easier to visualize.  For Tension we used slack to simulated the bot interactions, and for Wellbeing we made charts monitoring engagement on the fly and gathered what information the user would be looking for intuitively on our presenter HUD.</p>
        <p>For Wellbeing we were even able to do user testing before we had put keyboard to text editor by utilizing pen and paper wire-framing. We were able to quickly draw up new scenes and design ideas for the HUD.  We sometimes were able to mix and match some HUD scenes to see how the user would understand traveling back and forth for multiple pages.  From this we realized that we would be better off keeping the information to one screen size and to avoid segmenting the information on different pages. <a href="https://medium.com/@rachelbinx/why-you-should-be-prototyping-e4f7d55a6848">https://medium.com/@rachelbinx/why-you-should-be-prototyping-e4f7d55a6848</a></p>
        <p>While screenshots and designing UI mockups on a computer can more closely emulate the final product, I have found that pen and paper wire-framing forces the designer to be very direct one what they are attempting to test.  The designer needs to hand draw every detail that they think is important, so the functionality is the complete focus of the wireframe.  Whereas on a digital wireframe, it takes much less time to add superfluous flourishes to the design being tested.</p>
        <p>Once we have enough data the group naturally turns to building the project and the biggest problem awaits them. How are we going to know what to use?  In the beginning of the course there were so many options given on the toolchain that it was overwhelming.  In contrast, the end of the course provided a single suggestion per project and left the goal open ended.  Both sections provided their own challenges but required slightly different design considerations.  For the first half, the process that was used to determine the tools was brief research into each of the suggestions.  This included finding sample projects to get a sense of the scope that a simple and complex project would look like.  We didn’t want anything that would need a significant investment to do a basic hello world, but required something that scaled up well and was not limited to a sandboxed “easy” tool.  Later in the term was more open ended in terms of the aim of the project, but the tooling options were noticeably reduced.  Each project had an SDK that we were told to use and make something with.  For ease of access for others, each project was done in JavaScript. JS in it of itself presented issues because of how loose it is with its requirements and data types, posing a small technical challenge.  This was not as bad as actually finding the direction and modules for these projects.  To get started on these we first did our prototyping and user testing to get the idea nailed down.  We then scowered npm for readymade solutions to some of the challenges posed in making our project a reality.  For example, in Wellbeing, we have graphs and gauges to facilitate the communication of data at a glance to the presenter.  Both of these utilize node modules and allowed the design of the project to evolve rapidly.  When evaluating if the module was worth integrating into the codebase, we made sure to read documentation to determine how much time would be lost in order to do so.</p>
        <p>The gauges and graphs were a good example of modules that took very little time to implement but were important to the overall design of the project. They draw the user’s attention to the right spot, the changing data.  Managing the user’s attention can be hard and being conscious of what information will be read in what order is crucial.  When designing documents such as web pages, I make sure that color, size, and whitespace help guide the user’s attention to what information should be processed first. By doing this, I am able to predict where the user will be looking for functionality.  Carefully designing a document like this will also make the experience more intuitive for the user, causing them to enjoy it more. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/3-ways-to-improve-your-visual-design-skills-fa9dc8e583ff">https://uxdesign.cc/3-ways-to-improve-your-visual-design-skills-fa9dc8e583ff</a></p>
        <p>This same line of thought can be applied when doing data visualization such as in Understanding and Wellbeing.  Not all charts are created equally. Some charts communicate information more efficiently than others.  There is an ordered tier of clarity but it doesn’t need to be strictly adhered to.  Consciously choosing to use a ‘worse’ chart can sometimes fit the aesthetic of the overall project better without losing a significant amount of resolution or readability. When presenting data to a user, I generate a few graphs of the same data and try to ask simple questions to the user about the data.  This way I can see which ones take longer for the user to understand with the context of the rest of the document.  Then, I just need to strike a balance between visual appeal and the speed at which the data can be read and understood.</p>
        <p>When going back and revising the designs for final submission something I spend a significant time analyzing is the feedback I’ve collected.  For this class this came in the form of the peer reviews on demo day. With the short turnaround between demo day and submission, this part of my process was slightly abbreviated, so I was only able to take minor suggestions along the lines of spacing of elements or color choices.  Ideally I would also be able to implement the features that users would be looking for after the demo as these are the ideas that our project suggests to user.  </p>
      <h4 class="w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-10">Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The unifying theory behind my design contributions is: how do we help the user accomplish their goal.  Users will infer things about your product based off of its design in context of technology they have used before.  Therefore, understanding what your design suggests is important and what the user expects your project to do is even more important. The process I go through reflects this direction.  The mockups, user testing, color choice, and revision all serve this final purpose of making something communicates it capabilities clearly to the user without the use of explicit instructions.  Catering to the user does not mean adding everything and the kitchen sink into each product though.  I am a firm believer that a product should know what it does and do it well.  I do not go out of my way to weaken the core functionality of the product in order to add a tangential feature to it.  I want to offer a whole experience in one specific are or set of functions through a sleek application and enhance the user’s ability to complete the targeted task in the way that the user would like to do accomplish it.  This requires an open approach to tooling and providing the user with a sense of agency throughout the time that they use the program.</p>

        <p>Good design/Bad design is an exploration of design that is preexisting around us here on WPI’s campus. In these articles I go into detail about the concerns that are raised by poor design considerations and the many benefits of solving many problems through good design application.</p>

        <p>Design For Others is a redesign challenge that we were given.  We were tasked in redesigning a website that already existed for a specific group of people.  For my group, we were give tourists.  Some considerations that were taken into account were: language barrier, the need for directions, and highlighting which events were open to the public and which were members only.  There was a lot of thought put into the visual design of this project because of the first point, the language barrier.  With a strong visual design, the user should be able to get around the site well enough to find the information they are looking for in a reasonable amount of time. </p>

        <p>For Design For Understanding, my group took a dataset of information about billionaires and tried to express the high level trends through graphs and charts.  My personal contribution focused heavily on the interactive dotplot. This changes the location of individual dots representing billionaires based on the predefined filter buttons on the side of the webpage.  This was very effective in highlighting some of the points we were trying to make and got a lot of “wow”s from classmates.</p>

        <p>In Design For Tension, we took a swing at a topic relevant to most of our classmates.  We aimed to create a chat bot that imitated a financial counselor to help people determine if it was worth it to take on debt to go to school. The bot calculated the expected total cost of college as well as the amount of a loan that would be paid off in 10 years based on the expected income of the major that you are thinking about pursuing.  Ultimately the decision of whether someone should go to college and take on debt is up to the individual, but this doesn’t differ than if one was to go to  a real financial counselor.</p>

        <p>Design For Wellbeing was the first assignment that was more open ended.  We were given the Affectiva SDK and told to create something.  My group decided on making a tool for presenters/ lecturers.  It analyses the engagement and focus of the participating listeners and then aggregates them and displays averages in a graph and gauges.  This real time feedback aims at helping presenters change their strategies dynamically to change to something that would be better received by their audience. </p>

        <p>In Design For Another World the team took on a problem that the class had face all term long.  Where are all the groups on demo day? We created a 3D model of the class room and allowed users to fly around with the camera and mark where their group is located.  This would spawn a flag in the world that displayed a number over it to specify what group is where. When complete, a user can use this map to find the other groups that are presenting their projects in the room easily. </p>
